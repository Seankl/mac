    <td align="left" class="simple-text"><h4><strong>Standard terms</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">&quot;Money4Macs.co.uk&quot; is a trading as name of Laptops to go Ltd, 169 Avonvale Road, Redfield, Bristol, BS5 9RY.
        You must be 18 years or older to sell any device to Money4Macs.co.uk as the submission of your machine for collection and purchase represents a legally binding contract. You must also be the legal owner of the goods being sold. ALL items received will be checked against the online database of stolen Apple computers. Money4Macs.co.uk take a very dim view of anyone trying to sell us stolen goods, or committing any other fraudulent or criminal activity. Anyone found to be doing so will be reported to the relevant authorities. Money4Macs.co.uk logs all user's IP addresses.</p>
      <h4><strong>Collection</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">Money4Macs.co.uk only collect goods from UK mainland addresses. Our courier company collects Monday to Friday except bank holidays and national holidays. It is the responsibility of the sender to ensure that someone is available at the arranged address on the arranged date for collection to hand the parcel over to the courier. Any missed collections due to the computer not being available for collection, either due to the premises being closed or the parcel not being ready for collection will be charged at £12.50 plus VAT per failed attempt. We are just passing this fee on as the courier company will charge us for any missed collection. If a failed collection is caused by our courier's error or for calling after 5:30 PM then this fee will not be charged. Unfortunately we cannot stipulate to our courier company an exact time for collection, they only guarantee the date. The courier could collect any time between 9 AM and 5:30 PM. Collections in the London area can be up until 6:30 PM.</p>
      <h4><strong>Packaging</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">It is the responsibility of the sender to ensure the computer is suitably packaged. Courier companies move millions of parcels a day. Simply writing &quot;FRAGILE&quot; on the box is not adequate protection. If the original packaging from Apple is no longer available, computers need to be wrapped using <span style="color:red">large bubble bubble-wrap or foam </span>and packed in a sturdy <span style="color:red">double walled </span>cardboard box. For heavier items there needs to be at least 4 inches of padding around all corners. For lighter items such as laptops 2 or 3 inches should be adequate. Neither Money4Macs.co.uk nor our courier company can be held responsible for damage caused by inadequately packaged parcels. The condition of the goods received will be considered to be the condition when sent. The only exception will be if any parcel is deemed to be adequately packaged by our assessors but the box has clearly been damaged by the courier company then we will be happy to liaise and assist as much as possible in any claim with the courier company. Do not allow the courier to package your Mac.</p>
      <h4><strong>Our Quotes</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">The Money4Macs.co.uk website is fully automated. The quotes generated are based on the information you enter into the website and are only valid on receipt of your Mac in the same condition and with the same specifications as entered during the quote. The value of any device will change regularly over time. Your quote is valid only for the current session. When you choose to accept our quote all of the details are recorded to our system and later claims by the user that the Money4Macs.co.uk website quoted a different value will not be entertained. The quote is shown on screen and is e-mailed to your given e-mail address. It is the responsibility of the sender to ensure the quote you see on screen and the quote you receive by e-mail match and are as expected and to contact us prior to collection in the event that it does not. </p>
      <h4><strong>Inspection</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">On receipt of your Mac it will be immediately inspected and checked against your quote to check the condition and accessories declared. For all machines that turn on various diagnostic software will also be run. All Macs with no significant discrepancy from the declared information given during the quote will be authorised for immediate payment via your preferred payment method. Any Mac with a significant discrepancy from the declared information given during the quote release Money4Macs.co.uk from any time commitments regarding payment. The sender will be immediately notified and a new quote based on the actual condition and specification of the received Mac will be quoted. The sender will then have the option to accept the new quote or have their Mac returned to them along with our engineers report for a fee of £65 to cover the courier costs each way and the engineers assessment time along with administration costs.</p>
      <h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">Money4Macs.co.uk pay for your Mac within two working days of its collection. Working days are defined as Monday to Friday except bank holidays and public holidays.

All Macs that were properly described and accessories declared correctly at the time of quote will be paid out within one day of us receiving it. Any Mac with a significant discrepancy from the declared information given during the quote release Money4Macs.co.uk from any time commitments regarding payment.

      <h4><strong>Your Data </strong></h4>
      <p align="justify">Money4Macs.co.uk takes data security extremely seriously. On receipt of your Mac, after assessment and payment has been made the hard drive will be wiped of all data using industry recognised software using multiple pass algorithms to securely erase every sector on the hard drive. It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that all important data has been backed up or removed from the Mac as after this software has been run there will be zero chance of ever recovering any information from the hard drive. Money4Macs.co.uk may not be held liable or responsible for data deleted from supplied Macs. Money4Macs.co.uk will never make use of any data found on any machine. Money4Macs.co.uk will never pass on or sell data to a third party. If your Mac has confidential data on the hard drive feel free to data wipe the drive yourself. Money4Macs.co.uk will use external hard drives and software during the testing process so the OS is not essential. </p>

By submitting this information to Money4Macs.co.uk you hereby grant Money4Macs.co.uk all rights to this &quot;submitted information&quot;. Money4Macs.co.uk will not pass this information on or sell this information to a third party.</p>

In the unlikely event of this happening after collection we will return your Mac to you at no cost to you. The sender may cancel the agreement up until Money4Macs.co.uk collects your Mac. Once your Mac has been collected you are agreeing to accept the agreed amount for your Mac and cannot request that the Mac is returned. We may agree under exceptional circumstances to return a machine for a fee of £65 to cover the courier costs each way and the engineers assessment time along with administration costs.</p>
