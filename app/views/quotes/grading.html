      <br>

      <br>
      Grade D: The computer may have several scratches here and there, a few digs  or dents on the casing and slight screen damage (not smashed or bruised -  scratches only).<br>

      Please note that units sent in as 'Grade E' are expected to be complete. If  you have removed any components, please contact us beforehand as it may affect  your quote. If your Mac has a keyboard other than UK QWERTY then we will deduct  £10 from any price quoted as non-UK computers are harder to sell in this  country. Please bear this in mind when you accept your quote.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not include your charger with a laptop you are selling (including  faulty laptops) we will deduct £30 from the price that we quote for your computer.  This is due to the cost of replacing chargers - which is necessary to sell a  laptop on.<br>
      <br>
    If your computer is at all affected by cigarette smoke then your quote may  be substantially altered upon our receipt of the computer. This includes, but  is not limited to, visible staining, smell of cigarette smoke, internal  components coated in tar from being subject to use in a smoky environment.  Please bear this in mind and feel free to ask any questions before accepting a  quote.</td>
