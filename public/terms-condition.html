          <td valign="top" class="text"><p>1: Damage in shipment is not the responsibility of CashMyMac.co.uk or our courier*, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure that the Mac is suitably packaged for shipment and will not be damaged. The original box that your computer comes in is generally adequate for shipping. If you do not have the original packaging and are unsure of how to package your item, please call us on 01494 355 333 and we will advise. The Mac MUST be boxed in a minium of a double walled cardboard box. We advise against the use of small-bubble bubblewrap on anything other than laptops. For desktop computers you MUST use large-bubble bubblewrap, small-bubble bubblewrap will offer no protection as the weight of the computer is too great. Any packaging supplied by any persons or companies other than Apple or CashMyMac.co.uk must be appraised by a member of our staff in writing. If your own packaging has not been appraised, you will need to email at least one picture of the packaging and a description of the materials used to a member of staff. Without appraisal, neither the courier nor CashMyMac.co.uk can be held liable or responsible for any damage incurred to the computer while in transit. If you cannot source any packaging materials, we do offer a service to supply them, however we charge &pound;25+VAT for this. Any damaged, irreparable goods will either be returned to the sender (see point 2 for charges) or we will pay the faulty rate**. If you, the sender, believe that the packaging supplied by us is not adequate, please contact us immediately on 01494 355 333. Please do not allow the courier or their staff to pack the item for you, they are not qualified to do so. Please also note that if you would like to purchase packaging supplies from us payment is required upfront and is a separate transaction. It is not taken out of the final payment for your goods.<br />
<br />
2: Our engineers are trained to a high standard, and will test your computer to an industry standard level. Any faults or problems not specified at the time of agreeing to our terms and conditions will affect the quote significantly. In the event this happens, you will be contacted immediately by us. If a machine is tested and is found to be faulty when expected to be working, we are obliged to pay our book price for faulty macs. This is calculated on age and processor type (G4, G5, Intel) etc. If you are not satisfied, you can have the mac returned to you at your cost (Point 6). We can provide reports of our testing results upon request. We charge &pound;75+VAT to return macs found to be faulty, damaged and/or not specified correctly at the quoting process should you not accept the faulty book price. This covers the cost of collection, testing and re-delivery.<br />
<br />

Ee are only able to offer an estimated date of receipt of payment as transfer times vary from bank to bank.<br />
<br />
7a: Breakdown of payment options:<br />
<br />

<p>11: Any missed collections due to the computer not being availble for collection, either due to the premises being closed or the parcel not being ready for collection will be charged at &pound;10+VAT per failed attempt. This is a charge that the courier imposes for any collection attempts that are unsuccessful through no fault of their own. Any failed collection attempts due to a problem with the courier, or the driver attempting collection after 5pm will not be charged.</p>
<p>12: Our courier cannot guarantee the time at which they will collect the parcel, Interlink Express can only guarantee the date of collection. As they typically have many parcels to deliver as well as collections to do, we can only offer a window - normally 10am to 4pm. We can extend this upon request, but we cannot make it any smaller. If collection from your home address will be a problem we can arrange a collection from a friend/relative's house or a work address at no extra cost. Collections in the London area can be anytime from 9am to 6:30pm. For more information we can provide contact details of your local Interlink Express depot upon request.</p>
<p>13: You must be 18 years or older in order to sell your mac through CashMyMac.co.uk, as it binds a contract legally when you accept the quote. You must also be the legal owner of the goods, a condition which will be checked once the goods are with us. Any goods discovered to be stolen or any other fraudulent or criminal activity will be reported to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>14. At present CashMyMac.co.uk only accepts orders from within the British Isles. Highland areas and outlying islands are included but are subject to an additional charge imposed by our courier.</p>
<p>15. CashMyMac monitors and logs IP addresses and may block IP addresses from using our service for quality control. If you are not happy for your IP address to be logged then you have the right to decline to use our service.</p>
