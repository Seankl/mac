<p>Grade A: Your computer is clean and tidy, with no visible scrapes and scratches. All components are working correctly and there are no mechanical or cosmetic defects on the unit. This includes video quality.</p>
<p>Grade B: The computer is generally clean and unblemished, with allowances for small numbers of surface scratches on the bodywork, but not the screen. No digs or dents in the bodywork or casing.</p>
<p>Grade C: The computer is not as clean as it was when new, and has a few surface scratches, with maybe one or two slight dents on the casing, none of which are causing any difficulties in using the computer. No screen damage permitted.</p>
<p>Grade D: There are several scratches here and there, a few digs or dents on the casing, and slight screen damage (not smashed or bruised - scratches only).</p>
<p>Grade E: FAULTY. This grade is for damaged, unusable items including smashed or bruised screens, faulty logic boards, RAM, Hard drives, water damage, surface damage etc. This computer does not work.</p>
<p>Please note that units sent in as 'Grade E' are expected to be complete. If you have removed any components, please contact us beforehand as it may affect your quote. If your Mac has a keyboard other than UK QWERTY then we will deduct &pound;10 from any price quoted as non-UK computers are harder to sell in this country. Please bear this in mind when you accept your quote.</p>
<p>If you do not include your charger with a laptop you are selling (not excluding faulty laptops) we will deduct &pound;30 from the price that we quote for your computer.. This is due to the cost of replacing chargers - which is necessary to sell a laptop on.</p>
<p>If your computer is at all affected by cigarette smoke then your quote may be substantially altered upon our receipt of the computer. This includes, but is not limited to, visible staining, smell of ciagrette smoke, internal components coated in tar from being subject to use in a smoky environment. Please bear this in mind and feel free to ask any questions before accepting a quote.</p></td>
